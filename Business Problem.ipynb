    "For the final project, I chose the following business problem: Choosing the best Borough of New York City for the location of the Chinese Mall. \n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like a simple task, because Chinese goods have a significant price advantage. However, I assume that cheap Chinese goods will use the highest demand precisely in places with a greater concentration of people from China and India, since they are more accustomed to such goods.

    "To do this, I will follow 3 basic steps:\n",
    "1. Analysing the datasets of 5 boroughs\n",
    "2. Getting top 100 popular venues within for a given neighbourhood Using Forsquare APIs \n",
    "3. Exploring and analyzing the data of each borough\n"
